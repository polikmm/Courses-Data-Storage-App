    "title": "JavaScript Facts and Origins",
    "description": "JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the modern web, alongside HTML and CSS. It was created by Brendan Eich in just 10 days in 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communications. Originally named Mocha, then renamed to LiveScript, it was finally dubbed JavaScript to ride the wave of Java's popularity. Despite sharing part of its name, JavaScript is unrelated to Java. Over the years, JavaScript evolved from a simple scripting language to a powerful, versatile tool capable of both client-side and server-side development. Today, frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue, along with technologies like Node.js, have cemented its place at the heart of web development.",

    "title": "Women in Tech: Pioneers of Programming",
    "description": "The contributions of women to the field of computer science are both significant and often underappreciated. Ada Lovelace, working on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine in the mid-1800s, is widely regarded as the world's first computer programmer for her notes on the engine, which included an algorithm designed for machine computation. In the 20th century, Grace Hopper developed the first compiler for a computer programming language and was instrumental in the creation of COBOL, one of the earliest high-level programming languages. During World War II, the women known as the \"ENIAC Girls\" programmed one of the world's first electronic general-purpose computers, making pivotal contributions to the evolution of computing as we know it.",

    "title": "The Birth of Unix and C",
    "description": "In the late 1960s, Bell Labs engineers Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie created the Unix operating system, which would become a foundation for countless modern systems. Dennis Ritchie also developed the C programming language, designed to write Unix itself. C brought portability and flexibility, allowing software to be run on different machines with minor adjustments. This portability made Unix and C highly influential, shaping the design of subsequent systems and languages like C++, Java, and modern operating systems, including macOS, Linux, and Android.",

    "title": "Open Source and the Rise of Linux",
    "description": "In 1991, Finnish student Linus Torvalds announced a new free operating system kernel called Linux. Initially a personal project, it rapidly gained popularity in the open-source community. Unlike proprietary systems, Linux was openly developed and distributed, encouraging collaboration and innovation. Today, Linux powers the majority of the world's servers, all Android smartphones, and is the backbone of systems from supercomputers to cloud infrastructure. The Linux philosophy influenced modern software development, inspiring projects like Git, also created by Torvalds.",

    "description": "The internet began as ARPANET, a US Department of Defense project in the late 1960s. Its initial goal was to create a robust, fault-tolerant communication system. By the 1980s, networks began to interconnect, forming a global web of information. The invention of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 transformed the internet from a technical tool for researchers into a public platform for commerce, communication, and creativity. Today, over 5 billion people use the internet daily, reshaping every aspect of modern life from entertainment to healthcare and international politics.",
